Setup PowerShell Scripts Environment
1.1.	Permissions 
When you start PowerShell on a computer for the first time, the Restricted execution policy (the default) is likely to be in effect. You may not be able to run PowerShell scripts downloaded from Internet.
If you are using PowerShell ISE or Visual Studio Code, you need to run as administrator to change Policy. 
You may be able pin PowerShell IDE to taskbar, then Shift + right-click to Run with Elevated Rights. Run below one of the below scripts to change Policy:  

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope LocalMachine

Alternatively, you may be able to use the Unblock-File cmdlet (Unblock-File -Path .\fileName.ps1). 
1.2.	Install PowerShell Modules 

Install PowerShell Modules: 

Install-Module sqlserver

Install-Module -Name ImportExcel
